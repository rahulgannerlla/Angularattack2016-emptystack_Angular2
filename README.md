# EmptyStack

Contributors: Rahul Gannerlla, Alain Licona

The main scope of this project is to get hands on experience learning Angular2. In the span of 48 hours, We focussed on few of the very important aspects of Angular2:

* Use of Directives.
* Use of Components and Classes.
* Use of RestAPI to fetch data from external sources.
* Use of Material Design lite and CSS card styles.
* Lazy-loading.
* Routing.
* Handling larger amounts of data while parsing JSON.
* Observables and Subscribers.


**Emptystack project includes two modules.**

###  1) Search Product

First module directions:

* Enter the keyword you would like to search.

* We aggregate the results from Walmart and eBay using RestAPI.

* You can compare the results with in different entities and choose the item you like.

* We pipe JSON data from Walmart and eBay to data layer in the application.

* The data layer preprocesses the JSON file and pipes to Items directive.

**Coolest part: Items directive can be used any number of items for any number of external sources.**
